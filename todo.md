# Lifestyle Design Realty — Daily Reels Dashboard TODO

## Data Layer
- [x] Define DB schema: videos (library), reposts (history), daily_picks, app_settings
- [x] Generate + apply migration via webdev_execute_sql
- [x] Import ranked + city-classified video library (107: 20 Austin / 87 SA) into DB
- [x] DB helpers in server/db.ts for videos, reposts, daily picks
- [x] Stable hosted thumbnails (cover frames uploaded to static storage)

## Backend / Selection Engine
- [x] Selection logic: top IG views per city, 30-day no-repeat cooldown, auto next-best fallback
- [x] AI caption refresh procedure (opening lines only; CTA + hashtags preserved)
- [x] Generate today's two picks (Austin + SA) on demand / idempotent per day
- [x] Confirm-to-post procedure: records confirmation, schedules 2PM & 3PM CDT, writes repost history
- [x] Owner-only access enforced (adminProcedure / owner openId)

## Frontend
- [x] Daily Picks dashboard: two cards (Austin, SA) with thumbnail, views, city label, schedule
- [x] Editable caption field per pick (shows AI-refreshed caption)
- [x] One-tap Confirm button per Reel + Save edits + Regenerate
- [x] Post status indicator: pending / confirmed / posted / failed
- [x] Rotation history log page (date, city, thumbnail, views)
- [x] City-classified video library page (ranked by views, All/Austin/SA filter)
- [x] Elegant premium visual design (graphite + champagne gold, Cormorant + Inter)
- [x] Owner-only auth gating on all routes

## Posting Integration
- [x] Scheduled endpoints: /api/scheduled/dueForPublish, /api/scheduled/reportPublish
- [x] Repost publish tracking columns (igMediaId, publishError)
- [x] Owner-only authorization (ownerProcedure) on all feature + scheduled endpoints
- [x] Owner-denial + unauthenticated tests added (18 tests passing)
- [x] Daily posting agent playbook written (posting_playbook.md)
- [x] Instagram connector UID identified for scheduled tasks
- [x] Deploy site (live at repostdash-qirdbvnd.manus.space) — scheduled endpoints reachable + 403-guarded
- [x] Scheduled posting task created (single job, cron 0 0 19,20 * * *, America/Chicago = runs 2PM & 3PM CDT). Per-city due-times in the dashboard make SA post on the 2PM run and Austin on the 3PM run, guaranteeing 1hr separation. Instagram connector attached.

## Testing
- [x] Vitest for selection engine (30-day cooldown, fallback, scheduling)
- [x] Vitest for caption refresh (hashtags/CTA preserved)
- [x] Vitest for confirm flow (repost creation + idempotency)
- [x] Vitest for auth logout

## Mobile Responsiveness
- [x] Mobile top bar + bottom tab bar nav (sidebar hidden on small screens)
- [x] Daily Picks cards: stack thumbnail/caption vertically on mobile
- [x] Library grid: 2-up on phone, touch-friendly tiles
- [x] History: readable on narrow screens (single-line date)
- [x] Bottom padding so content clears the mobile tab bar (Home, History, Library)
- [x] Verified all pages at 375px viewport

## Multi-Account Posting (Meta Graph API) — CANCELLED by user (Jun 26)
- [~] Cancelled: requires a one-time Meta/Facebook login to generate a Graph API token, which the user cannot currently do. No code changes were made to the live app for this. Can be revisited later if Meta access is restored.
- Note: No partial multi-account code was committed; dashboard remains single-account (@lifestyledesignrealtytexas).

## Auto-Pilot Toggle (auto-confirm)
- [ ] Add autoPilot boolean to app_settings (DB)
- [ ] Backend: getSettings/setAutoPilot procedures (owner-only)
- [ ] When auto-pilot ON, picks.today auto-confirms both picks (creates reposts, marks confirmed/queued)
- [ ] Auto-Pilot toggle UI on dashboard with clear on/off state + explanation
- [ ] Note: Instagram connector still shows a final confirm card at post time (Meta rule) — document workaround
- [ ] Test + deploy

## App Logo + PWA + GitHub (Jun 26)
- [x] Design a cool "Lifestyle Design Studio" app icon/logo (square, home-screen ready) — house emblem (Option 2) selected
- [x] Generate PWA icon sizes (192, 512, apple-touch 180, favicon 32)
- [x] Add manifest.webmanifest + apple-touch-icon + theme-color meta + app title "Lifestyle Design Studio"
- [x] Verify "Add to Home Screen" works on phone (installable PWA) — manifest + icons + meta live & serving 200 on production
- [x] Create private GitHub repo "lifestyle-design-studio" (PropertyPete1, private)
- [x] Push dashboard code to the repo (165 files on main)
- [x] Deploy and hand over install instructions — published to repostdash-qirdbvnd.manus.space

## Bug: Blank screen on mobile (Jun 26)
- [ ] Investigate blank screen on mobile (likely service worker caching stale/empty shell, or SW interfering with auth)
- [ ] Fix and redeploy; verify on mobile

## Bug: Mobile shows "No picks available yet" (Jun 26) — UPDATED
- [x] Re-diagnosed: app shell renders fine on mobile; picks empty => owner not authenticated on phone (session not carrying) OR picks.today returns empty when unauthenticated
- [x] Confirmed: data is fine server-side (2 confirmed picks for today, valid videos + thumbnails); API correctly returns UNAUTHORIZED when not logged in
- [x] Root cause: service worker cached stale/empty app shell on mobile
- [x] Removed SW caching: self-destroying sw.js + auto-unregister/cache-purge on load
- [ ] Verify on mobile after redeploy

## Recurring Posting Agent (Jun 26)
- [x] Decided: Option B (confirm-each-time via IG card); AGENT cron fetches reel video and prepares post
- [x] Harden dueForPublish endpoint (now returns shortcode + permalink + caption); reportPublish already marks posted/failed
- [x] Verified flow: reportPublishHandler updates daily_picks + calls markRepostPosted/markRepostFailed (reposts row)
- [x] Saved checkpoint + user deployed (endpoints live, 403 for non-cron)
- [x] Scheduled AGENT cron: fires 19:00 + 20:00 UTC (2 PM SA / 3 PM Austin CDT), repeating, run-as-new, Instagram connector attached (taskUid he5uIWQiFJljmBdqvGrXLD)
- [x] Verified schedule active with correct cron/timezone; nothing fires today (next run tomorrow 2 PM CDT)
- [x] Deliver summary + how to manage/pause schedules

## Metricool Multi-Platform Integration (Jun 30)
- [x] Researched Metricool API - supports create scheduled post with autoPublish to all platforms
- [x] Stored METRICOOL_API_TOKEN secret, verified token works (blogId: 4807109, userId: 3748462)
- [x] Confirmed connected platforms: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook
- [x] Added METRICOOL_BLOG_ID (4807109) and METRICOOL_USER_ID (3748462) to env/secrets
- [x] Built server/metricool.ts: createScheduledPost() + getConnectedNetworks()
- [x] Built /api/scheduled/publishNow: agent fetches video URL, server calls Metricool to auto-publish to Instagram + TikTok + Facebook
- [x] dueForPublish returns shortcode + permalink + caption for agent to fetch video
- [x] Updated schedule playbook: fully automatic (no confirm tap), Metricool handles all platforms
- [x] Wrote vitest test for metricool helper (live API validation, 19/19 pass)
- [x] Pushed to GitHub (PropertyPete1/lifestyle-design-studio, commit f1fb556)
- [x] Saved checkpoint f8eef5a5 — ready to deploy to production

## Bug Fixes: 30-Day Rotation + Duplicate Picks (Jun 30)
- [x] Confirmed 30-day filter IS working correctly (today's picks are genuinely different from June 26's)
- [x] Fixed duplicate Austin picks: added UNIQUE(pickDate, city) DB constraint + idempotent insertDailyPick
- [x] Cleaned up: deleted duplicate Austin pick (id 30003), kept id 30002
- [x] Today's picks are now clean: SA (id 30001) + Austin (id 30002), both pending, correct postIds
- [x] Saved checkpoint 6333707f — ready to deploy to production

## Fix: 30-Day Rotation vs Real Instagram Posts (Jun 30) — SUPERSEDED by AI Visual Dedup
- [x] Superseded: AI visual dedup is a better solution (handles reposts with different IDs)

## AI Visual Deduplication for 30-Day Rotation (Jun 30)
- [x] Built ig_post_history table (igPostId, thumbnailUrl, captionSnippet, postedAt)
- [x] Built server/igHistorySync.ts: syncIgPostHistory() + getRecentIgHistory() + isVisuallyDuplicate()
- [x] isVisuallyDuplicate() uses LLM vision to compare candidate thumbnail vs recent IG thumbnails (same property/development detection)
- [x] Integrated into ensureTodayPicks: tries up to 10 candidates, skips visually similar ones, fallback to top-ranked if all flagged
- [x] Added /api/scheduled/syncIgHistory endpoint for agent to sync posts before pick generation
- [x] Seeded ig_post_history with 20 recent Instagram posts (June 12-29, 2026)
- [x] Deleted today's bad SA pick (id 30001) — will regenerate with AI dedup on next dashboard open
- [x] Updated schedule playbook to sync IG history before generating picks
- [x] Pushed to GitHub (efa74c4)
- [ ] Save checkpoint + deploy to production

## Bug: SA Pick Still Wrong + Metricool All Accounts (Jun 30)
- [ ] Diagnose why SA pick still shows wrong video after AI dedup delete+regenerate
- [ ] Force clean SA pick regeneration with AI dedup running correctly
- [ ] Confirm all Metricool connected networks (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) from live API
- [ ] Update publishNow to post to ALL connected Metricool accounts (not just Instagram)
- [ ] Deploy and verify

## Bug: SA Pick Keeps Repeating Same $279,990 House (Jun 30)
- [ ] Identify the $279,990 "All closing costs paid" video in the library (14.5K views, highest ranked SA video)
- [ ] Understand why it keeps winning selection despite being recently posted
- [ ] Fix: record confirmed picks in reposts table immediately on confirm (not just on post)
- [ ] Fix: ensure 30-day exclusion uses confirmedAt timestamp, not scheduledFor
- [ ] Delete today's bad SA pick and force regeneration with the fix in place
- [ ] Deploy and verify new SA pick is a genuinely different property

## ROOT CAUSE FOUND: Reposted video has different IG post ID (Jun 30)
- Library video id 22 (postId 18064623473412524, caption "bright light clean finishes") = same reel reposted June 28 as IG post 18100490300160803
- ID matching can't link them (different IDs); AI vision fails because ig_post_history thumbnails are EXPIRING Instagram CDN URLs (403 when AI fetches them)
- [ ] Fix: caption-fingerprint exclusion — exclude candidate videos whose caption matches a caption posted in last 30 days (ig_post_history)
- [ ] Normalize captions for comparison (lowercase, strip emoji/whitespace, first ~60 chars)
- [ ] Test, deploy, regenerate today's SA pick, verify different property

## FIX SHIPPED: Caption-fingerprint dedup (Jun 30)
- [x] Add captionFingerprint() (lowercase, strip emoji/punctuation -> words, first 80 chars) in igHistorySync.ts
- [x] Add isCaptionRecentlyPosted() — exact/prefix match + shared 4-word distinctive opening phrase
- [x] Wire isCaptionRecentlyPosted as PRIMARY dedup check in ensureTodayPicks() (before AI vision)
- [x] Fix fallback bug: when all candidates flagged, pick best CAPTION-CLEAN candidate instead of blindly using top-ranked video
- [x] Add captionDedup.test.ts (7 tests) covering the $279,990 reposted-house case
- [x] Verify type-check clean + all 26 tests pass
- [x] Runtime simulation with real DB captions: video 22 correctly flagged as duplicate (isDup=true)
- [x] Delete today's stale bad SA pick (id 90001, video 22) so it regenerates with fixed logic
- [x] Commit + push to GitHub (e0eb4e4), save checkpoint (e0eb4e46)
- [x] Verify SA pick regenerated as a genuinely different property (videoId 22 -> videoId 25, postId 17857030872602130; dev logs show video 22 skipped)
- [ ] User to click Publish to deploy fix to production

## Phone install (PWA) + LinkedIn target (Jun 30)
- [x] Add LinkedIn to Metricool posting targets (was IG/TikTok/YouTube only) + de-dupe networks
- [x] Map both linkedin (personal urn) and linkedinCompany fields to LINKEDIN
- [x] Add linkedinData block + dynamic platforms label in publishNow response
- [x] Add LinkedIn connectivity assertion to metricool.test.ts (verified live: IG, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn connected)
- [x] Verify prod manifest + icons + iOS meta tags serve correctly (all HTTP 200)
- [x] Add InstallAppButton: Android native prompt + iOS Add-to-Home-Screen instructions, hidden when already installed
- [x] Mount install button in mobile top bar
- [x] Type-check (clean) + tests (27 pass) + mobile layout verify
- [x] Adaptive iOS/Android instruction sheet; button shows on all phone-class devices
- [x] Extract pure installDetect helpers + 8 unit tests (verified: iPhone/iPadOS/Android show, desktop only with prompt, hidden when installed)
- [x] Include client tests in vitest config (35 tests total pass)
- [x] Checkpoint saved (89110b6e); hand off with install steps

## BUG: Mobile shows blank blocks (Jun 30)
- [x] Reproduce on mobile viewport (dev renders fine; issue is device-side stale cache)
- [x] Check logs: auth.me + picks.today both 200, no server errors — backend healthy
- [x] Verify prod assets/thumbnails load (JS 200, CSS 200, thumbs 307->200 image/jpeg)
- [x] Root cause: stale cached shell from old service worker on the device
- [x] Fix: early in-head SW-unregister + cache-purge guard (runs before app bundle)
- [x] Add boot fallback (spinner) so a failed load never shows blank screen
- [x] Remove boot fallback once React mounts
- [x] Add graceful <img> onError fallback ("Preview unavailable")
- [x] Verify Daily/Rotation/Library on 390x844 mobile viewport (all render)
- [x] Type-check clean + 35 tests pass
- [x] Checkpoint saved (d98aa068); hand off retest steps (force-refresh on phone)

## BUG: Metricool posts stay PENDING — "Video not available" / 4 errors (Jun 30)
- [x] Root cause part 1: post body shape (lowercase providers, media as {url,type} objects, drop saveExternalMediaFiles) — fixed, returns HTTP 200
- [x] Root cause part 2: IG CDN media URL expires/blocked → Metricool can't fetch video → "Add at least 1 image or video" on all networks
- [x] Real fix: upload the video into Metricool's OWN media library via their S3 upload flow (PUT /v2/media/s3/upload-transactions -> presigned S3 PUT -> PATCH complete), then post with the static.metricool.com hosted URL. External URLs always expire before Metricool ingests them.
- [x] Cracked the S3 403 SignatureDoesNotMatch: the transaction part `hash` MUST be base64(sha256) of the bytes, and the S3 PUT must send `x-amz-checksum-sha256` = that same base64(sha256). Metricool signs the presigned URL with that exact value.
- [x] Implemented uploadVideoToMetricool() in server/metricool.ts; createScheduledPost now uploads media by default (uploadMedia flag)
- [x] SECOND root cause: `media` must be an array of bare URL STRINGS. Sending [{url,type}] objects made Metricool silently persist EMPTY media (post then errors "add a picture/video"). Fixed createScheduledPost to send media: [url].
- [x] Fixed immediate-publish scheduling: added chicagoLocalDateTime() so publicationDate.dateTime is a true America/Chicago wall-clock string (was UTC ISO slice, ~5h late). Used in publishNowHandler + republish.
- [x] Re-published today's Austin reel via corrected path — VERIFIED PUBLISHED on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, AND LinkedIn (Metricool post 343860379); repost 30003 igMediaId updated
- [x] Scheduled cron publishNow flow calls createScheduledPost -> now auto-uploads media + uses Chicago-local time (no further change needed)
- [x] Added tests: uploadVideoToMetricool returns hosted CDN url; chicagoLocalDateTime timezone semantics (39 tests pass)
- [x] Checkpoint saved + deployed to production; all 4 scheduled endpoints live and auth-gated; cron verified for tomorrow (SA 2PM / Austin 3PM CDT)

## Multi-brand posting (max exposure across all connected IG accounts)
- [x] Discover ALL Metricool brands at post time via getAllBrands(simpleProfiles), not a hardcoded blogId
- [x] uploadVideoToMetricool now takes blogId + reusable prefetched bytes; authParams parametrized by blogId
- [x] createScheduledPost fans out to every brand (postToBrand) with that brand's networks (IG always; +TikTok/YouTube/LinkedIn on main)
- [x] Aggregated per-brand results into ok/platforms summary; partial failures surfaced in summary
- [x] publishNow already returns result.platforms summary and marks posted when >=1 brand succeeds (no change needed)
- [x] Live-tested fan-out to all 3 brands (3 posts created + cleaned up); added getAllBrands test; tsc clean
- [x] Auto add/remove: brands discovered live each run, so a newly connected IG is auto-included and a removed one drops out with no code change
- [x] Deployed to production (bundled with the Dallas release below)

## AI geo-classification + Dallas market (every 2 days)
- [x] Added `dallas` to city enums (videos, reposts, daily_picks); migration applied
- [x] geoClassify.ts: deterministic keyword pass + AI vision fallback -> san_antonio | austin | dallas
  - SA: San Antonio metro + Schertz, Cibolo, Alamo Ranch, New Braunfels, Boerne, Seguin, Canyon Lake
  - AUSTIN: Austin metro and NORTH (Round Rock, Georgetown, San Marcos, Temple, Killeen, Belton, Waco)
  - DALLAS: Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington, Plano, Frisco, McKinney, Denton, etc.
- [x] Re-classified existing library (107 videos): 89 SA / 18 Austin / 0 Dallas (no DFW reels in current synced source)
- [x] selection.ts: scheduleHourFor (SA 2PM/Austin 3PM/Dallas 4PM) + isDallasDay every-other-day cadence
- [x] ensureTodayPicks generates Dallas pick only on Dallas days; silently skips if no Dallas videos
- [x] Dallas fans out to ALL brands via existing multi-brand path; 30-day no-repeat applies
- [x] UI: Dallas-Fort Worth label, dashboard copy, Library filter tab, dynamic pick list
- [x] Scheduled task updated: cron 0 0 19,20,21 UTC (2/3/4 PM CDT), agent loops SA->Austin->Dallas
- [x] Tests: geoClassify, dallasSchedule (hour + cadence); 48 tests pass; tsc clean
- [ ] Checkpoint + deploy + verify in production
- [ ] NOTE FOR PETER: no Dallas/Fort Worth videos found in the synced IG source — need the account/videos that contain DFW reels for Dallas days to actually post

## Fort Worth deep backfill (one-time) (Jul 1)
- [x] Paginated full Instagram history via connector (~12 pages, ~230 posts)
- [x] Identified 6 genuine Fort Worth / DFW-area reels (Aledo ISD, Benbrook/Crowley ISD, Joshua ISD / DFW side)
- [x] Fetched real IG insights (views) per reel; hosted thumbnails on storage; upserted as city=dallas
- [x] Strengthened geoClassify with DFW suburb/ISD keywords (Aledo, Benbrook, Crowley ISD, Joshua ISD, Chisholm Trail, Mansfield, Burleson, etc.)
- [x] Library now: 89 San Antonio / 18 Austin / 6 Dallas
- [x] Verified a Dallas pick can generate (top eligible = post 18395283235198565, 1095 views, 0 reposts in 30d)
- [ ] Save checkpoint + user deploys
